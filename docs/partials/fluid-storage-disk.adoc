Fluids in the storage network can be stored on a {doctitle}, which must be placed in a xref:../pages/storage/disk-drive.adoc[].

== Upgrading

You can combine the {doctitle} with a higher tier xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part] to upgrade it.

The original xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part] will be returned.

== Uncrafting

Sneak and use an empty {doctitle} to retrieve its components:

- The corresponding xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part]
- xref:../pages/storage/storage-housing.adoc[]
