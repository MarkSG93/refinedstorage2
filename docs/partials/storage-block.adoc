The {doctitle} provides storage for the storage network.

It functions like a xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disk] but can be placed in the world.

> Breaking the {doctitle} drops it with all stored resources intact.

== Upgrading

You can combine the {doctitle} with a higher tier xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part] to upgrade it.

The original xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part] will be returned.

== Uncrafting

Sneak and use an empty {doctitle} to retrieve its components:

- The corresponding xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part]
- xref:../pages/utility/basic-processor.adoc[]
- xref:../pages/utility/machine-casing.adoc[]
