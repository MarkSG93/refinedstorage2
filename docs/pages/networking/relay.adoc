= Relay
:from: v0.4.0-alpha
:icon: relay.png

The {doctitle} acts as a connection buffer within a storage network. It has input sides and an output side and can conditionally transmit a network signal from the input sides to the output side.

== Pass-through

By default, the {doctitle} is in pass-through mode. This allows the network signal to flow directly from the input sides to the output side.

When pass-through mode is *off*, the {doctitle} stops transmitting the signal by default. From that point, the output side receives an isolated (empty) network unless specific components are manually passed through.

== Pass energy

When pass-through mode is off, the {doctitle} can be configured to pass energy from the input sides to the output side.

== Pass security

Security settings can also be passed through when pass-through mode is off.

== Pass autocrafting

When enabled, the {doctitle} exposes autocrafting patterns from the input sides to the output side.

- Tasks are executed in the output network using its resources.
- Autocrafters and patterns come from the input network.

=== Filter

The top row defines which patterns are exposed.

- Default mode: _blocklist_ — patterns in the filter are hidden.
- Empty blocklist: all patterns are exposed.
- _Allowlist_ mode: only listed patterns are exposed. If empty, none are exposed.

==== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxe’s damage value.

== Pass storage

When enabled, the {doctitle} exposes resources from storage to the output network.

=== Access mode

- **Insert and extract** – The output storage network can insert and extract resources.
- **Insert only** – The output storage network can only insert resources.
- **Extract only** – The output storage network can only extract resources.

=== Storage priority

The {doctitle}'s priority affects insert/extract order in the output network, with higher values taking precedence.
Insert and extract priorities can be set separately.

=== Filter

The top row defines which resources are exposed.

- Default mode: _blocklist_ — resources in the filter are hidden.
- Empty blocklist: all resources are exposed.
- _Allowlist_ mode: only listed resources are exposed. If empty, none are exposed.

==== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxe’s damage value.
