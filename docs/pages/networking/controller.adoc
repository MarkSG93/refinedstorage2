The {doctitle} powers the storage network.

Each network requires at least one {doctitle} to stay active. Multiple {doctitle}s can be used to meet higher energy demands.

== Generating energy

The {doctitle} does not generate energy on its own. It must be powered by an external energy source from another mod.

== Energy usage

- Energy is consumed per tick.
- Consumption depends on the number and type of connected devicesâ€”more devices require more energy.

If the {doctitle} runs out of energy, the network will attempt to draw power from another {doctitle}. If no backup is available, the network will shut down.

> Breaking the {doctitle} retains its stored energy.
