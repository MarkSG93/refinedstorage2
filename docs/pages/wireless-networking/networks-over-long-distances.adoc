= Networks over long distances

There are two ways to extend a storage network over long distances:

- xref:../viewing-resources/how-to-view-resources.adoc#_wireless_access[Wireless access to resources]
- Expanding the network without using cables

== The challenge

Accessing a storage network across multiple locations can be difficult, especially when they are far apart.

While cables like xref:../networking/cable.adoc[] can be used, laying thousands of blocks of cable is impractical for distant areas.

== The solution

A xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] and xref:network-receiver.adoc[] allow wireless network extensions.

1. Place a xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] at the main network.
2. Craft a xref:network-card.adoc[].
3. Place a xref:network-receiver.adoc[] at the remote location.
4. Right-click the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] with the xref:network-card.adoc[] to store its location.
5. Insert the xref:network-card.adoc[] into the xref:network-transmitter.adoc[].
6. Ensure both the xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] at the main network and the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] at the remote location are **chunkloaded before linking** and remain chunkloaded for the connection to stay active.

Once linked, machines can be connected to the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] like any other network device.
