In order to connect storage networks to each other wirelessly, a {doctitle} must be used on the transmitting end.
It sends a wireless signal to a xref:network-receiver.adoc[] via a xref:network-card.adoc[].

== Troubleshooting

> In order for the {doctitle} to work reliably the {doctitle} has to be placed in a loaded chunk.

If the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] cannot be reached, because it no longer exists or the chunk is not loaded, the {doctitle} will go into an error state and will keep retrying to connect with the xref:network-receiver.adoc[].

The {doctitle} can work in the current dimension or across different dimensions.
