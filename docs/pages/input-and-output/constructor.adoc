:from: v0.3.0-alpha

The {doctitle} places resources from the storage network into the block space in front of it.

> The {doctitle} requires an empty space in front of it to function.

== Filter

The top row of the {doctitle} specifies which resources should be placed. If no resources are set, it will not function.

=== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxeâ€™s damage value.

== Scheduling mode

If multiple resources are set, the {doctitle} follows a scheduling mode to determine placement order.

=== Default

Places each resource in order, moving to the next only if the current one is unavailable.

=== Round-robin

Places each resource in turn.

=== Random

Places a random resource from the filter.

== Fireworks

The {doctitle} can launch firework rockets into the air.

== Dropping items instead of placing blocks

The {doctitle} can drop items into the world instead of placing blocks.

> With a xref:../upgrades/stack-upgrade.adoc[], it drops stacks at a time.
