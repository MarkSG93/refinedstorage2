= Interface
:icon: interface.png
:from: v0.4.0-alpha

The Interface combines the functions of the xref:importer.adoc[] and xref:exporter.adoc[].

== Exporting

The top row configures which resources are exported from the storage network to the _intermediate storage slots_ below.

The bottom row contains the intermediate storage slots where exported resources are stored. These slots are accessible for extraction by external blocks.

=== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxeâ€™s damage value.

== Importing

The {doctitle} accepts resources from external blocks and places them in the intermediate storage slots. From there, they are instantly inserted into the storage network.

> The {doctitle} does not extract resources from adjacent inventories automatically; you must insert them manually.

== Differences from the Importer

* The xref:importer.adoc[] must be connected to an external inventory, while the {doctitle} provides intermediate storage slots where external blocks can insert resources.
* The xref:importer.adoc[] has no internal inventory and cannot receive resources directly.
* The {doctitle} inserts resources instantly, while the xref:importer.adoc[]'s speed depends on upgrades.

== Differences from the Exporter

* The xref:exporter.adoc[] must be connected to an external inventory, whereas the {doctitle} exports to intermediate storage slots.
* The {doctitle} instantly exports resources, while the xref:exporter.adoc[]'s speed depends on upgrades.

== Interface acting as an External Storage source

You may connect an xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] to an {doctitle}.

At that point, the {doctitle} cannot extract resources from other {doctitle}s that are acting as an External Storage source.

include::../../partials/redstone-mode.adoc[]

== Applicable upgrades

- xref:../upgrades/crafting-upgrade.adoc[] (1)
* Starts an autocrafting task if the exported resource is missing.
