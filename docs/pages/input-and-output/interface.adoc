= Interface
:icon: interface.png
:from: v0.4.0-alpha

The Interface combines the functions of the xref:importer.adoc[] and xref:exporter.adoc[].

== Exporting

The top row configures which resources are exported from the storage network to the _intermediate storage slots_ below.

The last known state for each configured resource is displayed:

- **None** – The resource was exported successfully or hasn't been exported yet.
- **Resource missing** – The resource is not available in the storage network.
- **Storage does not accept resource** - The resource could not be returned to the storage network as the storage network is full or does not accept the resource.
- **Autocrafting started** – An autocrafting task was started for the missing resource (requires a xref:../upgrades/autocrafting-upgrade.adoc[]).
- **Autocrafting detected missing resources** – The autocrafting task could not start due to missing ingredients.

The bottom row contains the intermediate storage slots where exported resources are stored. These slots are accessible for extraction by external blocks.

=== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxe’s damage value.

== Importing

The {doctitle} accepts resources from external blocks and places them in the intermediate storage slots. From there, they are instantly inserted into the storage network.

> The {doctitle} does not extract resources from adjacent inventories automatically; you must insert them manually.

== Differences from the Importer

* The xref:importer.adoc[] must be connected to an external inventory, while the {doctitle} provides intermediate storage slots where external blocks can insert resources.
* The xref:importer.adoc[] has no internal inventory and cannot receive resources directly.
* The {doctitle} inserts resources instantly, while the xref:importer.adoc[]'s speed depends on upgrades.

== Differences from the Exporter

* The xref:exporter.adoc[] must be connected to an external inventory, whereas the {doctitle} exports to intermediate storage slots.
* The {doctitle} instantly exports resources, while the xref:exporter.adoc[]'s speed depends on upgrades.

== Interface acting as an External Storage source

You may connect an xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] to an {doctitle}.

At that point, the {doctitle} cannot extract resources from other {doctitle}s that are acting as an External Storage source.

include::../../partials/redstone-mode.adoc[]

== Applicable upgrades

- xref:../upgrades/autocrafting-upgrade.adoc[] (1)
* Starts an autocrafting task if the exported resource is missing.
