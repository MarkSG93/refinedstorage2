The {doctitle} extracts resources from a connected external inventory and inserts them into the storage network.

> Ensure that the {doctitle} is connected to the external inventory from the correct side, so it can access the desired slots for importing.

== Behavior

Each tick, it extracts as much of a single resource type as allowed by its per-tick quota. It cannot extract multiple resource types at once.

== Filter

The top row of the {doctitle} allows you to configure which resources can or cannot be imported.

By default, the {doctitle} is in _blocklist_ mode, meaning resources in the filter slots _will not_ be imported. An empty blocklist allows all resources.

You can switch to _allowlist_ mode, where only listed resources will be imported. If no resources are configured in allowlist mode, nothing will be imported.

=== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxeâ€™s damage value.
