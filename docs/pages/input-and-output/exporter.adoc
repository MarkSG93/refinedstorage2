The {doctitle} extracts resources from the storage network and inserts them into a connected external inventory.

> Ensure the {doctitle} is connected to the external inventory from the correct side, so it can access the desired slots for exporting.

== Filter

In the top row of the {doctitle}, specify which resources should be exported. If no resources are set, the {doctitle} will not function.

=== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxeâ€™s damage value.

== Scheduling mode

If multiple resources are set, the {doctitle} follows a scheduling mode to determine exporting order.

=== Default

Exports each resource in order, moving to the next only if the current one is unavailable.

=== Round-robin

Exports each resource in turn.

=== Random

Exports a random resource from the filter.
