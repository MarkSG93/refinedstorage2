:from: v1.0.5

The {doctitle} transfers resources between xref:../storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disks] and the storage network.

> The {doctitle} was formerly known as "Disk Manipulator".

== Transfer modes

- **Insert into network** – Moves resources from the storage disks into the storage network.
- **Extract from network** – Moves resources from the storage network into the storage disks.

== Filter

The top row configures which resources can or cannot be transferred.

- Default mode: _blocklist_ — resources in the filter are blocked.
- An empty blocklist allows all resources.
- _Allowlist_ mode allows only listed resources.
If empty, nothing will be transferred.

=== Fuzzy mode

Fuzzy mode, off by default, determines whether the filter considers additional attributes, such as a pickaxe’s damage value.

== Applicable upgrades

- xref:../upgrades/speed-upgrade.adoc[] (4)
* Increases transfer speed.
- xref:../upgrades/stack-upgrade.adoc[] (1)
* Increases transfer amount per tick.
