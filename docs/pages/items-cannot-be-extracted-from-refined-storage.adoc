= Troubleshooting: Items cannot be extracted from Refined Storage

Are you running into a bug where you can put an item into Refined Storage, but then you can’t get it back out? It looks like it’s there in the xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[], but clicking or shift-clicking doesn’t work.

This is a known issue that can happen with some modded items, especially tools, weapons, or fluids from other mods.

Refined Storage depends on very precise internal data to identify items. If another mod adds an item that doesn’t handle this data properly, the system can’t recognize the item when you try to take it out — even though it looks the same.

== What should you do?

This is **not** a bug in Refined Storage.

You should:

1. Report the issue to the mod that adds the item (for example: Silent Gear).
2. Include a link to this page so the mod developer can see what's going wrong.
3. Mention that the item can't be extracted from Refined Storage, even though it's shown correctly.

You can say something like:

> This item can be inserted into Refined Storage but not extracted. The issue is likely with how your mod handles data components. See link:https://refinedmods.com/refined-storage/items-cannot-be-extracted-from-refined-storage.html#_for_mod_developers[]

== For mod developers

If you're seeing this page because a player reported an issue with your items in Refined Storage, here's what’s going on:

When Refined Storage tries to extract an item, it reconstructs the item based on its item ID and data component map, and tries to match it to an existing stack in storage.

If your mod adds data components to a stack and doesn't implement proper equality checks for that data, the reconstructed stack won’t match the stored stack — causing extraction to silently fail.

This can happen with tools, weapons, or anything that stores internal data like modifiers, parts, traits, fluids, etc.

=== How to fix

- Make sure any custom data components used in your items or fluids override `equals()` and `hashCode()` correctly.
- Test inserting and extracting your items in a basic Refined Storage setup (xref:networking/creative-controller.adoc[] + xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[] + xref:storage/1k-storage-block.adoc[]) to verify behavior.

Once fixed, your items will work as expected with Refined Storage and other mods that rely on accurate stack comparison.
