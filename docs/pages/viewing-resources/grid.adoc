The {doctitle} allows access to the resources stored in the storage network.

You can insert and extract resources in the storage network within the {doctitle}.

You can place the {doctitle} in any direction, but the {doctitle} does _not_ transmit a network signal in the direction it's facing.

== Autocrafting

Autocraftable resources can be crafted by clicking the resource, or by using CTRL + click if the resource is already available. This opens the autocrafting preview.

In the preview, you can:

- Adjust the amount to craft.
- View a live simulation of the crafting steps.
- Click **Max** to craft the maximum possible amount.
- Enable **Notify** to receive a notification when the task is complete.

== Searching

Use the text box at the top of the {doctitle} to search.
You can just type words to search for resources with that name in your storage network.

However, the search is more powerful than that, supporting an entire query language with syntax highlighting.

- You may use logical operators like `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) .
- You may use parentheses to group expressions.
- You may use following unary operators:
* `!` (NOT)
* Search by mod name with `@`
* Search in tooltips with `#`
* Search in tags with `$`
* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for amount comparisons

=== Search box autoselected

include::../../partials/search-box-autoselected.adoc[]

=== Recipe viewer synchronization

The search box can be configured to synchronize with the recipe viewer search box, one-way (from the {doctitle} to the recipe viewer) or two-way synchronization.

- xref:../addons/emi.adoc#_recipe_viewer_synchronization[EMI]

=== Remember search query

The {doctitle} can be configured to remember the search query when closing and re-opening the {doctitle}.
You can do this by modifying the `rememberSearchQuery` config option.

== Sorting

The resources in a {doctitle} can be sorted in a ascending or descending manner in various ways:

- By name
- By quantity
- By ID
- Last modified

> The sorting type applies to all {doctitle}s and is stored on the client for each player.

== Display

=== Autocraftable resources

Resources that can be autocrafted are shown with an orange-tinted background, making them easy to identify at a glance.

Even if the corresponding xref:../autocrafting/pattern.adoc[] is only in your inventory and not yet inserted into an xref:../autocrafting/autocrafter.adoc[], the resource will still be marked as autocraftable.

=== View type

The {doctitle} can be configured to only show autocraftable resources or only show non-autocraftable resources.

> The view type applies to all {doctitle}s and is stored on the client for each player.

=== Resource type

The {doctitle} can be configured to only show certain resource types. By default, all resource types are shown.

=== Size

include::../../partials/size.adoc[]

=== Detailed tooltips

By default, the tooltips for resources in a {doctitle} are a little bit bigger to display the total amount and the last modified information.
This can be turned off by using the `detailedTooltip` config option.

=== Other configuration

By default, the {doctitle} uses a small font size to display resource amounts.
Use the `largeFont` config option to change this.

The scrollbar uses __smooth-scrolling__, if you prefer regular scrolling you can use the `smoothScrolling` config option.

== Prevent sorting while shift is down

By default, the {doctitle} doesn't sort when you are inserting and extracting resources from the network.
As soon as you stop pressing the SHIFT key, the view is sorted again.

To disable this behavior, modify the `preventSortingWhileShiftIsDown` config option.
