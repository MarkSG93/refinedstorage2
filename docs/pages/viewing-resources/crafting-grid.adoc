= Crafting Grid
:icon: crafting-grid.png
:from: v0.3.0-alpha

The {doctitle} functions like a regular xref:grid.adoc[] but includes a crafting inventory.

== Controls

Additional controls xref:grid.adoc#_controls[on top of the existing Grid controls]:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Action | Description

| **CTRL + X** | Clears the crafting matrix into the storage network. A separate keybinding allows clearing to the player inventory.
| **CTRL + SHIFT on the crafting result slot** | Filters the {doctitle} view based on the items in the crafting matrix.
|===

== Crafting inventory restocking

After crafting an item, the {doctitle} attempts to refill the crafting slots with the same items from the storage network.

== Crafting inventory close behavior

By default, items in the crafting inventory remain when closing and reopening the {doctitle}.

The `craftingMatrixCloseBehavior` config option can be adjusted to clear the matrix to either the player inventory or the storage network upon closing.

== Recipe transferring

The {doctitle} integrates with various recipe viewer mods for seamless recipe transferring:

- xref:../addons/just-enough-items.adoc#_recipe_transferring_in_the_crafting_grid[Just Enough Items]
- xref:../addons/roughly-enough-items.adoc#_recipe_transferring_in_the_crafting_grid[Roughly Enough Items]
- xref:../addons/emi.adoc#_recipe_transferring_in_the_crafting_grid[EMI]

If an item is not available for transferring, but autocrafting is available for it, you are able to trigger autocrafting for the missing items immediately from the recipe viewer.
