= How to view resources

== Grid

Use a xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[] or xref:../viewing-resources/crafting-grid.adoc[] to view and interact with resources in your storage network.

== Wireless access

You can access your storage network remotely using wireless tools.

1. Craft a xref:../wireless-networking/wireless-grid.adoc[] and bind it by right-clicking a xref:../networking/controller.adoc[].
2. Add a xref:../wireless-networking/wireless-transmitter.adoc[] to your network.

You can now access storage wirelessly within the transmitter’s range.

To increase range, place additional xref:../wireless-networking/wireless-transmitter.adoc[wireless transmitters] throughout the world. Avoid placing them directly next to each other for best coverage.

== Portable Grid

To access a specific xref:../storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disk] independently, use a xref:../viewing-resources/portable-grid.adoc[].

Charge it, insert a disk, and use it anywhere—no storage network required.

== Storage Monitor

To monitor a specific resource’s amount in the network, use a xref:../viewing-resources/storage-monitor.adoc[].

Configure it with the resource you want to track. You can view the count and insert or extract directly from the monitor.
