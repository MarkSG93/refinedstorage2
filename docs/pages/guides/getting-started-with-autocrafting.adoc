= Getting started with autocrafting

Autocrafting automates crafting within your storage network.
While you can already craft manually using the xref:../viewing-resources/crafting-grid.adoc[], autocrafting lets the network handle it for you.

== Patterns

Autocrafting requires a xref:../autocrafting/pattern-grid.adoc[] to create xref:../autocrafting/pattern.adoc[patterns].
Each pattern defines how a specific resource is crafted.

=== Pattern dependencies

You must create a pattern for every intermediate item.
If an item needed for crafting isn't in storage, the system will use its pattern to craft it.
If no pattern exists for that sub-item, it will be marked as missing and the task won’t start.

=== Example

To autocraft a link:https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chest[chest]:

- Create a pattern for the chest.
- If planks are available, they’ll be used.
- If planks run out, create a pattern for crafting planks too.

=== Fuzzy mode

Enabling Fuzzy mode on a pattern allows alternative inputs (e.g. any type of wooden plank).

== Autocrafters

Once your patterns are ready, insert them into a xref:../autocrafting/autocrafter.adoc[] connected to the storage network.

== Requesting a resource

With the patterns in place, you can request the resource from any xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[].

Click the resource (or CTRL + click if it's already available) to open the autocrafting preview. From there, you can:

- Set the desired amount
- View a live simulation
- Click **Max** to craft as much as possible
- Enable **Notify** to get a notification when the task is complete

Autocrafting tasks cannot start unless all required resources are present or autocraftable.

== How autocrafting works internally

When an autocrafting task starts:

- The required resources are pulled into an internal task inventory.
- All crafting is done inside this internal inventory—no changes are visible to the network while the task runs.
- This prevents other operations from interfering with the task.

If resources are added to the network mid-task, they’ll be intercepted by the task if needed.

== Monitoring autocrafting tasks

Use a xref:../autocrafting/autocrafting-monitor.adoc[] to monitor and cancel active tasks.

To check tasks remotely, use a xref:../wireless-networking/wireless-autocrafting-monitor.adoc[].

== Managing patterns

To view and organize all patterns across the network, use the xref:../autocrafting/autocrafter-manager.adoc[].

== Speeding up autocrafting

Insert xref:../upgrades/speed-upgrade.adoc[speed upgrades] into xref:../autocrafting/autocrafter.adoc[autocrafters] to increase the crafting speed.
