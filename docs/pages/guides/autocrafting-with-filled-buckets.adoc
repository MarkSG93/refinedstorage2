= Autocrafting with filled buckets

Some recipes require filled fluid buckets. To automate this using fluid storage, create a xref:../autocrafting/pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[processing pattern] with:

**Inputs:**

- 1 empty bucket
- 1 bucket of the desired fluid

**Output:**

- 1 filled bucket

Insert the pattern into a xref:../autocrafting/autocrafter.adoc[] facing a bucket-filling machine (e.g., a link:https://teamcofh.com/docs/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/[Fluid Transposer from Thermal Expansion]).

The autocrafter will output the fluid and the empty bucket. The external machine is responsible for filling the bucket.

When the external machine is finished processing, get the filled bucket back into the storage network.
