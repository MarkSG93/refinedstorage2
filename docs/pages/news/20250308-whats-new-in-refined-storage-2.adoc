= What's new in Refined Storage 2
:type: article
:description: The first beta of Refined Storage v2.0.0 has been released. What's new?
:date: 2025-03-08

Since 2020, I've been working on Refined Storage 2—an evolution of the original mod, rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on code quality, modern architecture, and Fabric support. After years of development and public GitHub milestones, the first beta is now available on CurseForge and Modrinth for Minecraft 1.21.1.

== Background

Refined Storage is nearly ten years old, and its codebase was starting to show its age. While none of the original 2015 code likely remained—thanks to years of refactors—it still felt like the right time for a clean slate.

The biggest issue with the old version was that, while functional, its internal structure had become a burden. It lacked tests, and the architecture made it difficult to maintain, evolve, or prevent regressions.

I started Refined Storage back in high school. Today, I'm a professional software engineer. I wanted the codebase to reflect that growth and be something I could keep enjoying and supporting.

Rewriting a mod of this size was a big risk. It could’ve failed. But I believed it was necessary to secure the long-term future of the project.

Refined Storage 2 has been rebuilt from the ground up with:

- A strong focus on code quality
- Long-term maintainability
- Mod loader independence
- A complete rethinking and modernization of nearly every feature

== What has changed?

Refined Storage 2 is a complete rewrite, modernizing and rethinking nearly every part of the mod. Below is a categorized and detailed overview of the most important changes and additions.

=== Official integrations and addons

To reduce core complexity, integrations have been moved to their own addon mods.

Removed from core into a dedicated addon:

- xref:../addons/just-enough-items.adoc[]
- xref:../addons/curios.adoc[] (NeoForge)

New integrations:

- xref:../addons/roughly-enough-items.adoc[]
- xref:../addons/emi.adoc[]
- xref:../addons/mekanism.adoc[**Mekanism integration** with chemical storage support]

- NeoForge config screen
- xref:../addons/fabric-ecosystem.adoc[]
* xref:../addons/trinkets.adoc[]

=== Viewing resources

- The *Fluid Grid* was removed. The regular xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[*Grid*] now handles items, fluids, and chemicals.
* image:../../assets/news/whats-new-in-refined-storage-2/combined-grid.png[Single Grid with items, fluids and chemicals]
- Fluids and chemicals can be inserted by right-clicking a container onto the Grid.
- The Grid supports a *Resource Type* filter, defaulting to "All".
- Grid tag search now uses `#`, and tooltip search uses `$`.
- The *Grid search bar* supports complex expressions and syntax highlighting.
* image:../../assets/news/whats-new-in-refined-storage-2/grid-search.png[Grid with advanced search query]

* Never
* Lock until redstone pulse

== Infrastructure improvements

Refined Storage 2 wasn’t built in isolation. As part of its development, the broader Refined Mods ecosystem saw major upgrades:

- The website was overhauled with a brand-new wiki system that supports multiple versions side by side.
- The wiki was completely rewritten from scratch.
- link:https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedarchitect[Refined Architect] was created—a shared project used across all Refined Mods. It includes GitHub workflows, version management, and a Gradle convention plugin to simplify (cross-platform) mod development.

== What's next?

Refined Storage 2 will continue to receive frequent updates with new features and bug fixes. Most new functionality will be released as part of addons.
