= What's new in Refined Storage 2
:type: article
:description: The first beta of Refined Storage 2 has been released. What's new?
:date: 2025-03-28

Since 2020, I've been working on Refined Storage 2—an evolution of the original mod, rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on code quality, modern architecture, and Fabric support. After years of development and public GitHub milestones, the first beta is now available on CurseForge and Modrinth for Minecraft 1.21.1.

== Background

Refined Storage is nearly ten years old, and its codebase was starting to show its age. While none of the original 2015 code likely remained—thanks to years of refactors—it still felt like the right time for a clean slate.

The biggest issue with the old version was that, while functional, its internal structure had become a burden. It lacked tests, and the architecture made it difficult to maintain, evolve, or prevent regressions.

I started Refined Storage back in high school. Today, I'm a professional software engineer. I wanted the codebase to reflect that growth and be something I could keep enjoying and supporting.

Rewriting a mod of this size was a big risk. It could’ve failed. But I believed it was necessary to secure the long-term future of the project.

== Goal

Refined Storage 2 has been rebuilt from the ground up with the following goals in mind:

- A strong focus on code quality
- Long-term maintainability
- Mod loader independence (support for Fabric and NeoForge)
- A complete rethinking and modernization of nearly every feature

== What has changed?

=== Infrastructure improvements

Refined Storage 2 wasn’t built in isolation. As part of its development, the broader Refined Mods ecosystem saw major upgrades:

- The website was overhauled with a brand-new wiki system that supports multiple versions at a time.
- The wiki was completely rewritten from scratch.
- On the more technical side, link:https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedarchitect[Refined Architect] was created—a shared project used across all Refined Mods. It includes GitHub workflows, version management, and a Gradle convention plugin to simplify (cross-platform) mod development.

== What's next?

Refined Storage 2 will continue to receive frequent updates with new features and bug fixes. Most new functionality will be released as part of addons.
