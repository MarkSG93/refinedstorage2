= Fallback Security Card
:from: v2.0.0

When a xref:security-manager.adoc[] is added to a storage network, access is locked for all players by default.

To define permissions for players that do not have a matching xref:security-card.adoc[], use a {doctitle}.

Once configured, insert the {doctitle} into a xref:security-manager.adoc[].
