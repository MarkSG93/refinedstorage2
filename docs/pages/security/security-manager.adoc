= Security Manager
:from: v1.4.0-beta
:icon: security-manager.png

The {doctitle} is used to lock down a storage network and define player permissions through inserted xref:security-card.adoc[Security Cards].

== Behavior

Once placed, the entire storage network becomes restrictedâ€”**including for the player who placed it**.
To restore access, insert appropriate xref:security-card.adoc[Security Cards] into the {doctitle}.

> The player who placed the {doctitle} can always open its interface.
> Server operators bypass all security restrictions.

== Multiple security managers

You can place multiple {doctitle}s in the same network.

If a player has multiple active xref:security-card.adoc[Security Cards], an action is denied if **any** {doctitle} blocks it.

== Fallback Security Card

When a {doctitle} is active, network access is locked for all players by default.

To define permissions for players **without** a matching xref:security-card.adoc[], insert a xref:fallback-security-card.adoc[].

> If multiple xref:fallback-security-card.adoc[Fallback Security Cards] are present, an action is denied if **any** of them blocks it.
