The {doctitle} is used to configure player permissions in a storage network.

To set permissions, use the {doctitle} in your hand. If it isnâ€™t bound to a player yet, it will automatically bind to you.

> To bind it to another online player, click the player button at the top of the screen.

Once configured, insert the {doctitle} into a xref:security-manager.adoc[].

To reset all permissions, press SHIFT and use the {doctitle}.
