== Core concepts

Refined Storage is a storage mod that lets you build a **storage network** using different devices. These devices store, organize, and manage your items and fluids.

In this guide, you will:

- Craft a xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[], which holds item or fluid storage disks. These disks provide storage for your network.
- Craft a xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[], which lets you view, insert, and extract items from your storage.
- Connect these devices to form a **storage network**.
- Power your storage network using a xref:networking/controller.adoc[]. This block provides energy, which is required for the network to function.

== Terminology

Here are some key terms to understand before you start:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Description
| **Storage network** | A system of connected devices that store and manage items or fluids. Requires power from a xref:networking/controller.adoc[].
| **Storage network device** | Any block that connects to the storage network, such as a xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[], xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[], or xref:input-and-output/importer.adoc[].
| **Resource** | Any item, fluid, or other storable material that can be managed by the storage network. Resources can be inserted, extracted, transferred, and stored using various devices.
| xref:networking/controller.adoc[**Controller**] | The power source of the storage network. Without it, the network won't function. You may add multiple controllers to satisfy the power demands of your storage network.
| xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[**Grid**] | A block that allows you to view, insert, and extract items from the storage network.
| xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[**Disk Drive**] | A block that holds xref:storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disks], which store items or fluids.
| xref:storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[**Storage Disk**] | An item that stores resources when placed inside a xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[]. Comes in different sizes (e.g., 1K, 4K).
| xref:storage/index.adoc#_storage_blocks[**Storage Block**] | A block-based alternative to xref:storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disks]. Functions similarly but placed in the world instead of a xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[].
| xref:networking/cable.adoc[**Cables**] | Used to connect devices to the storage network. Not needed if devices are placed directly next to each other.

== A minimal setup

=== Install Refined Storage (if needed)

Check if Refined Storage is included in your modpack by looking at the mod list.

If it's missing, or if you're creating your own modpack, follow the xref:how-to-install.adoc[installation instructions].

You may also want to check out the xref:how-to-install.adoc#_optional_dependencies[optional integrations] with other mods.

=== Crafting the Controller

The xref:networking/controller.adoc[] is the **power source** for your storage network.

1. Craft a xref:networking/controller.adoc[].
2. Place it down and **connect it to an energy source**.

Once powered, your storage network is ready to be expanded.

=== Adding storage and accessing items

To store and retrieve items, you need:

- A xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[] to hold storage disks.
- A xref:storage/1k-storage-disk.adoc[] to store items.

For simplicity, we'll use a **1K Storage Disk**, which can hold **1,000 items**. Higher-tier disks offer more storage.

**Steps:**

1. Craft a xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[].
2. Craft a xref:storage/1k-storage-disk.adoc[] and place it inside the Disk Drive.
3. Craft a xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[] to access your items.
4. Connect the Disk Drive and Grid to the Controller using xref:networking/cable.adoc[]. If placed directly next to each other, cables are not needed.

> Instead of xref:storage/index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disks], you can also use xref:storage/index.adoc#_storage_blocks[storage blocks]. These function similarly but are placed as physical blocks in the world and don't need a xref:storage/disk-drive.adoc[].

=== Viewing your storage

Now, open the xref:viewing-resources/grid.adoc[]. You can:

- **Insert** items to store them on your storage disks.
- **Extract** items whenever you need them.

Your basic storage network is now up and running!
