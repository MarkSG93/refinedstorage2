= How to install

Refined Storage runs on a modloader, supporting **NeoForge and Fabric**.

Installing it follows the same process as any other NeoForge or Fabric mod.

== Setting up NeoForge or Fabric

You'll need a working NeoForge or Fabric instance. Launchers like MultiMC or the vanilla launcher can set this up.

== Downloading the mod

Download a Refined Storage `.jar` file for your Minecraft version and modloader from official sources:

- link:https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage[CurseForge]
- link:https://modrinth.com/mod/refined-storage[Modrinth]
- link:https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage2/releases[GitHub]

== Installing the mod

Place the downloaded `.jar` file in your instance's `mods/` directory.
If the folder doesn't exist, start your instance once to let the modloader create it.

=== Using the CurseForge App (and other launchers)

Most launchers, including the CurseForge App, allow one-click installation without manually copying `.jar` files.

== Configuring the mod

Configuration isn't required in most cases, but you can adjust settings in the `config/` directory:

- **NeoForge**: `config/refinedstorage-common.toml`
- **Fabric**: `config/refinedstorage.toml`
