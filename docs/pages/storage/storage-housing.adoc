A Storage Housing is an empty xref:index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disk] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_disks[fluid storage disk] without an assigned xref:index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part].

It can be used to craft a new storage disk by combining it with the corresponding xref:index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part].
