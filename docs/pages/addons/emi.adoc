= EMI

Refined Storage integrates with EMI to enhance crafting and recipe interaction.

[#_recipe_transferring_in_the_crafting_grid]
== Recipe transferring in the Crafting Grid

You can transfer recipes from EMI directly into the xref:../viewing-resources/crafting-grid.adoc[].

- Missing ingredients? The transfer will still place what you have.
- If autocrafting is available for missing ingredients, you can start autocrafting tasks from the preview.
