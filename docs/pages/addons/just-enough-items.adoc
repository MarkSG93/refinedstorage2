= Just Enough Items (JEI)

Refined Storage integrates with Just Enough Items (JEI) to enhance crafting and recipe interaction.

[#_recipe_transferring_in_the_crafting_grid]
== Recipe transferring in the Crafting Grid

You can transfer recipes from JEI directly into the xref:../viewing-resources/crafting-grid.adoc[].

- Missing ingredients? The transfer will still place what you have.
- If autocrafting is available for missing ingredients, you can start autocrafting tasks from the preview.

[#_recipe_transferring_in_the_pattern_grid]
== Recipe transferring in the Pattern Grid

Recipes from JEI can also be transferred into the xref:../autocrafting/pattern-grid.adoc[].
The interface will show which ingredients are autocraftable.

== R/U key support
You can use the R and U keys on xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[] and filter slots to view recipes and usages respectively.

[#_recipe_viewer_synchronization]
== Recipe viewer synchronization

You can sync the search box between JEI and the xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[]:

- One-way (Grid â†’ JEI)
- Two-way sync
