== Recipe transferring in the Crafting Grid

Refined Storage will warn you when you don't have the required item present in your inventory, storage network or crafting matrix.
Even with this warning, you can still transfer items.

If you don't have some required items, but autocrafting is available for said items, you can press CTRL + CLICK to start autocrafting for said items.
Note that you need a xref:../autocrafting/pattern.adoc[] configured for these items.
