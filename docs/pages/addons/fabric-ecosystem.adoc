= Integration with the Fabric ecosystem

Refined Storage includes optional integration with several popular mods in the Fabric ecosystem.

== ModMenu

If ModMenu is installed, Refined Storage will appear in the mod list with a dedicated configuration button.
This allows easy access to configuration options without navigating to the file system manually.

== ClothConfig

When ClothConfig is present, the configuration button in ModMenu will open a user-friendly interface for editing the Refined Storage config file.
This eliminates the need to manually edit `.toml` files.

== Team Reborn Energy

If Team Reborn Energy is available, Refined Storage will use it as an energy backend for devices that consume energy.
