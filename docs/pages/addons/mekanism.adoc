= Mekanism integration

This optional integration adds support for Mekanism chemicals in various Refined Storage components, allowing storage, transfer, viewing, and autocrafting with chemicals.

== Chemical storage

Chemical storage blocks and disks allow you to store chemicals in the storage network. Each tier has a specific capacity:

- **64B** stores 64 buckets of any chemical
- **256B** stores 256 buckets
- **1024B** stores 1,024 buckets
- **8192B** stores 8,192 buckets
- **Creative** stores an infinite amount of buckets

They support uncrafting and upgrading like any other storage disk.

== Importer

The xref:../input-and-output/importer.adoc[] supports extracting chemicals from external chemical tanks into the storage network.

== Exporter

The xref:../input-and-output/exporter.adoc[] can insert chemicals from the storage network into external chemical-compatible machines or tanks.

== External Storage

The xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] can connect to Mekanism chemical tanks, allowing them to act as external storage for chemicals.

== Storage Monitor

The xref:../viewing-resources/storage-monitor.adoc[] can display the amount of a configured chemical in the storage network.

== Autocrafting

You can autocraft chemicals by using xref:../autocrafting/pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[processing patterns] that define chemical inputs and outputs.
The xref:../autocrafting/autocrafter.adoc[] will insert chemicals into compatible machines, and expect the output chemicals to be returned to complete the task.
