= Fluid autocrafting

In addition to items, the storage network also supports autocrafting with fluids.

All fluid-based recipes are created using xref:pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[processing patterns]. These patterns send inputs to an external machine and expect defined outputs in return.

You can use a fluid container to define the fluid as an input or output for the pattern. Alternatively, you can use xref:pattern-grid.adoc#_recipe_transferring[recipe viewer transferring integration].

With fluid autocrafting, the xref:autocrafter.adoc[] can handle both fluid and item inputs/outputs. Once the expected fluid or item is returned to the storage network, the task is marked as complete.

You can freely mix fluid and item inputs and outputs in a single processing pattern.
Fluids can also be requested directly from the xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[].
