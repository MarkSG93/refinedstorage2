= Pattern Grid
:icon: pattern-grid.png
:from: v0.6.0-alpha

The {doctitle} functions like a regular xref:../viewing-resources/grid.adoc[] but also supports creating xref:pattern.adoc[patterns].

== Supported pattern types

You can create patterns for:

- xref:pattern.adoc#_crafting_patterns[Regular crafting recipes]
- xref:pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[Processing recipes]
- Stonecutter recipes
- Smithing Table recipes

== Modifying existing patterns

Insert a {doctitle} into the output slot of the {doctitle} to modify it.

[#_recipe_transferring]
== Recipe transferring

You donâ€™t need the actual resources in your network to create a xref:pattern.adoc[].

The {doctitle} integrates with recipe viewer mods for recipe transferring:
- xref:../addons/just-enough-items.adoc#_recipe_transferring_in_the_pattern_grid[Just Enough Items]
- xref:../addons/roughly-enough-items.adoc#_recipe_transferring_in_the_pattern_grid[Roughly Enough Items]
- xref:../addons/emi.adoc#_recipe_transferring_in_the_pattern_grid[EMI]
