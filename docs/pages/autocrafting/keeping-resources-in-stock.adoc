= Keeping resources in stock

1. Place an xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[] with a xref:../upgrades/autocrafting-upgrade.adoc[].
2. Configure the resource in the xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[] to keep in stock â€” autocrafting will trigger when needed.
3. To make the stocked resource accessible to the storage network, attach an xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] to the xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[].
4. Set the xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] to **"extract-only"** mode. This prevents the network from inserting resources into the Interface, ensuring it only _extracts_ from the stocked supply.
