= Processing recipes

== What are processing recipes?

In xref:getting-started-with-autocrafting.adoc[], you learned how to automate regular crafting recipes.

But what if you want to automate tasks that don’t use a crafting grid—like smelting iron ore into ingots?
For this, you use xref:pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[processing patterns].

== Creating processing patterns

Use the xref:pattern-grid.adoc[] in processing mode to create a xref:pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[processing pattern].
The interface allows defining up to 9 inputs and 9 expected outputs:

- **Inputs** – Resources pulled from the storage network and inserted into the machine.
- **Outputs** – Resources expected back in the storage network after processing.

== Example

To automate the conversion of
link:https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore[Iron Ore] → link:https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot[Iron Ingot]:

- Set **1 Iron Ore** as the input.
- Set **1 Iron Ingot** as the output.

=== Alternatives

For each input, you can define allowed alternatives using link:https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag[Minecraft’s tag system].

== Using the pattern

1. Place a xref:autocrafter.adoc[] facing the machine correctly (e.g., furnace) so it can insert inputs into the correct slot.
2. Insert the xref:pattern.adoc#_processing_patterns[processing pattern] into the autocrafter.
3. When requested, the autocrafter will insert the inputs into the machine.

You must ensure the output is returned to the storage network—this is how the storage network knows that the task can be completed.

Use a device like:

- xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[]
- xref:../input-and-output/importer.adoc[]

== Chaining autocrafters

You can xref:autocrafter.adoc#_chaining[chain multiple autocrafters] to a single machine to handle more patterns for a single machine.
