= Comparing Refined Storage with Applied Energistics

Refined Storage and Applied Energistics 2 are often compared - sometimes fairly, often reductively. These comparisons tend to focus on which mod has more features, is more complex, or resembles the other more closely. But somewhere along the way, we forget an important truth: *Refined Storage does not exist to be AE2.*

== The problem with constant comparison

Whenever Refined Storage is discussed, it’s almost always in relation to AE2:

* “Does Refined Storage support this AE feature?”
* “Refined Storage is basically a simplified AE.”
* “Refined Storage isn't even close to AE.”

This mindset is limiting. Why does its worth have to be measured by how closely it resembles or deviates from AE?

It frames Refined Storage not as a standalone mod with its own goals and vision, but as a derivative product constantly trying to catch up or prove itself as an alternative to AE2.

== Let Refined Storage exist

Refined Storage was never designed to copy AE2.

It was created with its own philosophy and its own design goals: simplicity, accessibility, and intuitive design. Its strength lies in offering a distinct experience for players who want powerful automation *without* having to dive deep into mod-specific mechanics.

Refined Storage is not trying to compete with AE2. It's not a fork. It's not a lesser version. It's a different answer to the same problem.

== Why becoming too similar is a problem

If Refined Storage continues to evolve by adopting AE2’s systems just to meet expectations, the line between both mods will blur. And when the differences disappear, so does the reason for both to coexist.

What makes the modding scene rich is *variety*. If Refined Storage becomes just a more "user-friendly AE2", we’re not innovating—we’re duplicating. And duplication leads to redundancy, not choice.

== But what are the actual differences?

If you're wondering what truly sets Refined Storage and AE2 apart - just try them. No wiki article or YouTube breakdown can replace the experience of actually building a network in both mods. The differences in design philosophy, usability, and complexity quickly become obvious once you're hands-on. Let the gameplay speak for itself.

== Mutual respect between developers

It's important to recognize that the developers behind AE2 and Refined Storage have a mutual respect for each other's work. These mods weren’t created out of rivalry - they exist because different approaches can coexist and thrive in the same ecosystem. The modding community benefits from this diversity, and the devs understand that.

Refined Storage isn't trying to replace AE2, and AE2 isn’t trying to outdo Refined Storage. Both are valuable because they offer *choice*.

== Conclusion

Refined Storage should be allowed to grow on its own terms. It doesn’t need to "catch up" to AE2, and it certainly doesn’t need to become it.

Constantly framing Refined Storage in AE's shadow not only dismisses the huge effort behind it, but also ignores the people who genuinely prefer Refined Storage for what it is.

Let it stand on its own. Let it breathe. Let it be appreciated, not as "the AE alternative", but as Refined Storage. Not everything needs to be compared. Sometimes, it just needs to *be*.
